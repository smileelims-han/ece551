< As you take the magic whistle from the wizard's hand, he disappears in apuff of smoke. You decide that you should give the whistle a try before youset off to deal with the dragon (after all, if you learned nothing else inschool, it was that testing is VERY important). You think of a raven and blow on the whistle "CAW CAW CAW CAW". Then youthink of a chicken and blow "COCKADOODLEDOOOO". It seems like the whistleworks great, though you wonder how many different birds you can think ofand how they would help you deal with the dragon. Putting that question in the back of your mind, you contemplate whether ornot you should get some help before you set out. On the one hand, if you goalone, you might be able to better sneak into the dragon's lair. On theother hand, help might be useful.Fortunately for you, the two wisest people you know, Denevieve and Grew,live in the next village over. Thinking about it for several minutes, youdecide whom to go to for help.

You grab a rock off theground, stuff it in, and think of delicious toast with raspberry jam. A fewseconds later, out pops the most perfectly done toast with just the rightamount of butter and jam. Wow that is good! You spend a while longertesting the toaster again and again "just to be sure". After you arestuffed on toast, you start to wonder how this will help you with thedragon.

< After thinking about it a bit, you decide that Denevieve is probably abetter choice. After all, her singing skills are likely to come in handy,especially with your magic whistle. Maybe dragons can be tamed by choirmusic and bird calls? That could be right, but you aren't sure--you sleptthrough that day of Magical Creature Biology class. After knocking on the door, Denevieve is surprised to hear about the dragonthreat but is happy to help you. After all, you were her best student andtested every piece of code extensively and incrementally. Surely you can betrusted with a quest about dragons.The two of you set off into the hills and find the cave of the dragon. Youtake a minute to confer about your musical options and come up with a shortlist of three possible combinations to tame the dragon.
