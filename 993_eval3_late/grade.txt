< After you explain your quest and demonstrate your magic shoes, Denevieve

< 
< "First, we need to model the dragon as a rigid body and your magic shoes as
< a point mass. Then we apply Lagrange’s Equations and... hmm this would be

< of the dragon's head." She says, indicating a point on the dragon's head in
< her free-body diagram. 
< 
< The two of you set off to the dragon's cave, and you carefully jump at
< exactly the right place while Denevieve distracts the dragon with a lecture
< about Coulomb friction. Your mighty jump knocks the dragon
< unconscious. While the dragon is passed out, you tie him up.
< 
< When the dragon wakes up, you work out an agreement where the dragon will
< learn C++ programming and earn his food by writing software instead of
< stealing it.
