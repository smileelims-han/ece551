< After thinking about it for a bit, you decide Denevieve is a better
< choice. After all she teaches undergraduate Dynamics, so surely that can
< help you fight a dragon? 
< 
< After you explain your quest and demonstrate your magic shoes, Denevieve
< pulls out a whiteboard and explains how to make it work: 
< 
< "First, we need to model the dragon as a rigid body and your magic shoes as
< a point mass. Then we apply Lagrangeâ€™s Equations and... hmm this would be
< much easier if the dragon's cave were a frictionless surface, but we
< probably can't assume that, so instead (she writes big complicated equation
< and does a bunch of calculus)... Ok, you need to jump right here on the top
< of the dragon's head." She says, indicating a point on the dragon's head in
< her free-body diagram. 
< 
< The two of you set off to the dragon's cave, and you carefully jump at
< exactly the right place while Denevieve distracts the dragon with a lecture
< about Coulomb friction. Your mighty jump knocks the dragon
< unconscious. While the dragon is passed out, you tie him up.
< 
< When the dragon wakes up, you work out an agreement where the dragon will
< learn C++ programming and earn his food by writing software instead of
< stealing it.

< Everyone lives happily ever after.
---
> After knocking on the door, Denevieve is surprised to hear about the dragon
> threat but is happy to help you. After all, you were her best student and
> tested every piece of code extensively and incrementally. Surely you can be
> trusted with a quest about dragons.

< Congratulations! You have won. Hooray!

> The two of you set off into the hills and find the cave of the dragon. You
> take a minute to confer about your musical options and come up with a short
> list of three possible combinations to tame the dragon. 
> 
> What would you like to do?
> 
>  1. Silent Night, accompanied by raven calls
>  2. Angels We Have Heard on High, accompanied by roosters crowing
>  3. Bohemian Rhapsody, accompanied by the magestic call of a bald eagle
> You take out your whistle and Denevieve starts to sing
> 
> "Si--iii-lent niiight" (CAW CAW CAW)
> "Ho--oly night" (CAW CAW).
> "Aaaalll iiss calm aaaalll is bright" (CAW CAW).
> 
> As Denevieve sings and you make bird calls, the dragon comes out of his
> cave looking quite angry. 
> 
> "WHO DARES DISTURB MY SLUMBER... Oh hello. You look tasty."
> 
> The dragon eats you.

> Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!
