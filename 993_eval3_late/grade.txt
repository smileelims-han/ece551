< The file name should start with pageX.
---
> One day, a strange old wizard comes to your village and tells you that
> there is an evil dragon lurking in the hills. This wizard's story explains
> why the village's goats and cows have been going missing lately.
> 
> The wizard tells you: "It is up to you, hero, to stop this dragon. Nobody
> else in this village is foolish...errrr I mean brave enough to stop this
> dragon." 
> 
> The wizard offers you a choice of one of three magic items to help you on
> your quest. 
> 
> The first is a magic whistle that lets you make any bird call that you
> want. The second is a pair of magic shoes that let you jump 10 feet in the
> air. The third is a magic toaster, which can take any item that you can fit
> into it, and turn it into perfectly cooked toast (optionally with butter
> and/or jam). 
> 
> "Choose wisely, for your quest and your village depend on you."
> 
> What would you like to do?
> 
>  1. Choose the magic whistle.
>  2. Choose the magic shoes.

Test case 2 (success): cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1/page2.txt
1c1,24
< The file name should start with pageX.

> As you take the magic whistle from the wizard's hand, he disappears in a
> puff of smoke. You decide that you should give the whistle a try before you
> set off to deal with the dragon (after all, if you learned nothing else in
> school, it was that testing is VERY important). 
> 
> You think of a raven and blow on the whistle "CAW CAW CAW CAW". Then you
> think of a chicken and blow "COCKADOODLEDOOOO". It seems like the whistle
> works great, though you wonder how many different birds you can think of
> and how they would help you deal with the dragon. 
> 
> Putting that question in the back of your mind, you contemplate whether or
> not you should get some help before you set out. On the one hand, if you go
> alone, you might be able to better sneak into the dragon's lair. On the
> other hand, help might be useful.
> 
> Fortunately for you, the two wisest people you know, Denevieve and Grew,
> live in the next village over. Thinking about it for several minutes, you
> decide whom to go to for help.
> 
> What would you like to do?
> 
>  1. Go to Denevieve for help.
>  2. Go to Grew for help.
>  3. Go alone.

> 
> You put on the shoes and start jumping all over the village. As you bound
> over fences and onto the roofs of small houses, your fellow villagers look
> at you in awe. You are sure you could win any basketball game but are a
> little more worried about how you will deal with a dragon.

> 
> Having not had any breakfast, you are quite hungry, so testing the toaster
> seems like a great solution to two problems. You grab a rock off the
> ground, stuff it in, and think of delicious toast with raspberry jam. A few
> seconds later, out pops the most perfectly done toast with just the right
> amount of butter and jam. Wow that is good! You spend a while longer
> testing the toaster again and again "just to be sure". After you are
> stuffed on toast, you start to wonder how this will help you with the
> dragon. 
> 
> Putting that question in the back of your mind, you contemplate whether or

< The file name should start with pageX.

> After thinking about it a bit, you decide that Denevieve is probably a
> better choice. After all, her singing skills are likely to come in handy,
> especially with your magic whistle. Maybe dragons can be tamed by choir
> music and bird calls? That could be right, but you aren't sure--you slept
> through that day of Magical Creature Biology class. 
> 
> After knocking on the door, Denevieve is surprised to hear about the dragon
> threat but is happy to help you. After all, you were her best student and
> tested every piece of code extensively and incrementally. Surely you can be
> trusted with a quest about dragons.
> 
> The two of you set off into the hills and find the cave of the dragon. You
> take a minute to confer about your musical options and come up with a short
> list of three possible combinations to tame the dragon. 
> 
> What would you like to do?
> 
>  1. Silent Night, accompanied by raven calls
>  2. Angels We Have Heard on High, accompanied by roosters crowing
>  3. Bohemian Rhapsody, accompanied by the magestic call of a bald eagle

> cymbal.
> 
> The dragon wakes up, roasts you like a marshmallow, and eats you whole.
> 
> Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!
